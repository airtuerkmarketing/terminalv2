# terminalv2 — Build Log

Running record of what's been built, when. Newest entries on top.

The **Current State** block below is the only present-tense status; everything under
it is append-only history (do not rewrite past entries — add new ones).

---

## Current State (updated 2026-06-23)

- **Stack:** Next.js 16.2.9, React 19.2.4, Tailwind CSS 4, Supabase Postgres 17,
  pnpm 11. Deployed on Vercel, serving [www.airtuerk.dev](https://www.airtuerk.dev)
  (Webflow/`terminal.airtuerk.de` retired).
- **Database:** 28 tables + the `profiles_v` view (RAG foundation added 6:
  `company_context`, `confluence_chunks`, `brand_chunks`, `ai_chat_sessions`,
  `ai_chat_messages`, `ai_corrections`). **55 pages**, **15 brands**,
  **9 storage buckets** (public: `images`, `documents`, `videos`, `fonts`, `avatars`;
  private: `library`, `presentations`, `rag-knowledge`, `confluence-attachments`).
  `pgvector 0.8.0` + `pg_trgm 1.6` installed. Highest migration:
  `20260623093507_seed_company_context_knowledge_base`. Highest decision: **D-061**.
  RAG corpus: **438 chunks** (page 134 / pdf 159 / office 60 / brand 43 /
  knowledge_base 14) + **34 company_context** entries. Edge functions:
  `embed-knowledge` (7 source modes), `rag-query` (+ 3 confluence fns).
- **Auth/roles:** `super_admin | admin | user`; RLS via `is_admin()` /
  `is_super_admin()` / `get_profile_role()`; profile role-changes are
  super-admin-only (D-055).
- **Shipped:** Phases 0–4 + design system; File System v2 (roles + folder Document
  Library); User Panel (admin/users list + detail, role picker, seeded key users,
  profiles↔team_members link, `user_activity_log`); Presentation Hub rebuild (0033);
  all four APIX tool ports (0014–0016); signature + out-of-office generators;
  intelligence/RAG groundwork (0025–0029) + live `/api/search`; dead-code cleanup
  (`c397b29`); `/internal-branding/configurator` removed (D-056).
- **Remaining:** full Admin CMS (Phase 5), IBE Tools Showcase port, RAG chat UI +
  correction workflow (File 03), email notify + gold-set re-run (File 04).

## RAG-airtuerk V2 — curated knowledge base (2026-06-24)

**Status:** Applied/deployed to prod. Decision **D-061**. Demo-critical priority insert.

Integrated the curated `airtuerk-intelligence-knowledge-base.md` (v1.2, Business
Development) to close content gaps (PAX/year, ~170 airline partners, B2B product
suite, ATBeds/airtuerk International leads, no-setup-fee onboarding). Added
`'knowledge_base'` to the `confluence_chunks.source_type` CHECK; uploaded the MD to
the `rag-knowledge` bucket (Storage, not hardcoded — the file has backticks that
break a template literal, and Storage allows re-curation without redeploy); new
`embedKnowledgeBase` handler downloads it, splits on H2, **drops the "Excluded /
Review Items" meta-section** (conflicting revenue / unconfirmed URLs that must not
surface) → 14 chunks (148–692 tok) from 8 sections. Plus 6 priority-1
`company_context` entries. `rag-query` labels these "airtuerk Intelligence: <section>".
QA verified: PAX/year, ATBeds lead, setup-fees all answer correctly + cited.

---

## RAG-airtuerk V2 — pipeline + rag-query (2026-06-24)

**Status:** Applied/deployed to prod. Decisions **D-059** + **D-060**. File 02 complete.

Initial embedding run (Atomic 2.1): **424 chunks**, 0 errors (page 134 / pdf 159 /
office 60 / brand 43 / context 28). Required a Voyage payment method (free tier =
3 RPM, 429'd); 200M free tokens still apply so cost ≈ $0. The chunker took 3
iterations — the snapshot stores body_text as one newline-free line, so the
original paragraph-splitter made 1 giant chunk/page (max 8026 tok); rewrote to
cascade paragraph→line→sentence + char-window hard-split + **bounded tail-overlap**
(max ≤801 tok, proven: unit ≤700 + overlap ≤100). 12/15 brands embedded (APIX /
IBE-parent / Presentation-Hub have 0 content blocks — legit).

`rag_hybrid_search` SQL function (D-059, migration `20260623082750`): priority-1
context always + per-source vector arms + pg_trgm keyword arm, `DISTINCT ON` dedup,
SECURITY INVOKER + pinned search_path. Caught + fixed a plan bug — bare
`ORDER BY/LIMIT` on non-final UNION arms is a Postgres syntax error; arms
parenthesized.

`rag-query` edge function (D-060): streaming Claude Opus 4.8, **no temperature / no
thinking / no effort** (C1). Two bugs caught in verification: (1) **identity-crowding**
— 20 priority-1 ctx rows @1.0 would fill the 8-chunk budget, so reserve 2
mission/brand_voice slots + rerank the other 6 via Voyage rerank-2.5; (2) **DISTINCT
ON order** — `rag_hybrid_search` returns `(source, source_id)` order not score, so
the CEO answer fell past the 30-row rerank cap → sort by combined_score before
slicing. C4 (pre-insert + finally-update), C5 (expose headers), C14 (weiss-nicht is
a logged safety-net; refusals handled by Claude system-prompt rules — empty
retrieval is structurally unreachable while priority-1 context exists).

QA (Atomic 2.5): **9/9 in-corpus correct + cited, Q10 (Quantenmechanik) refused**;
domain-expert fact-check passed (Pegasus PNR, Hara Filo +20%, Y360, Mavi Gök,
check-in windows). Warm TTFB 2–3s isolated; outliers under rapid burst (Anthropic
rate-limit) — Phase-04 watch (gold-set throttling + perf polish). **Next:** File 03
frontend (needs its own AIChatWindow turn-based recon first).

---

## RAG-airtuerk V2 — foundation migration (2026-06-23)

**Status:** Applied to prod. Decision **D-058**. Migration `20260623060259_rag_foundation`.

Start of the airtuerk-KI build (learnable, source-citing internal RAG; plan in
`OneDrive/terminal/`, 4 files / 35 atomic prompts). Recon (Atomic 1.1) verified live
DB before any write — confirmed 86 confluence_raw, 116 attachments w/ text, 15 brands,
55 published pages, 43 blocks, 84 gold-set rows; existing helpers `set_updated_at` /
`is_admin` / `is_super_admin` / `get_profile_role` all present; pg_trgm in, vector +
pg_net not yet. Caught plan drift: D-057 was already taken (→ RAG uses D-058+),
migration naming is timestamped, and the frontend already renders AI answers through a
turn-based `AIChatWindow` (not the inline shape the plan assumed) — frontend phase will
get its own recon + diff-approval round before code.

**Applied (D-058):** pgvector + the 4-layer schema (`company_context`,
`confluence_chunks`, `brand_chunks`, `ai_corrections`) plus `ai_chat_sessions` /
`ai_chat_messages`. HNSW on all embedding columns, pg_trgm GIN on chunk content, RLS
FORCED on all six, reuse of `set_updated_at`. FK types verified against live schema
(text↔text for Confluence, uuid↔uuid for brand/page/block) before apply. Post-apply
verification green: pgvector 0.8.0, 6 tables RLS+FORCE, 3 HNSW + 1 trgm index,
`set_updated_at` unchanged.

Then deployed the `embed-knowledge` edge function (6 source handlers; Voyage key
checked lazily so a zero-work call returns `chunks_created:0` without a key;
`tsconfig` already excludes `supabase/functions` so no Vercel-build impact) and
seeded `company_context` — migration `20260623070454_seed_company_context`, **28
identity entries** (20 priority-1, 5 `needs_review`) pulled from live
brands/team_members/`kanal` data, not plan templates. Design rule (approved): no
unverified operational facts at priority-1 (always-injected → would poison every
answer); PNR/cancellation/check-in are priority-2 pointers, real values come from
Layer 2 (`confluence_chunks`). Ran `{source:'context'}` → **28/28 embedded** (Voyage
voyage-4-large, 1024-dim). Edge Function Secrets (VOYAGE/ANTHROPIC/RESEND) +
Vault (SERVICE_ROLE_KEY) all set. **Next:** Atomic 2.1 bulk embedding run
(confluence + attachments + brands, ~2300 chunks) → `rag-query` pipeline.

## Upload fix — browser direct-to-Storage signed-URL upload (2026-06-22)

**Status:** On feature branch → PR into `main`. Decision **D-057**. App-layer only, no migration.

Reported bug: on `/documents-library/business-development/03-tour-operator-agreement`
the upload modal showed "Uploading…" then hung — no file, no error. **Diagnosed** (not
guessed): the file streamed THROUGH the Next.js Server Action, which caps bodies at
1 MB by default (not raised in `next.config.ts`); files over ~1 MB were rejected at the
framework boundary, and the client had no try/catch, so the rejected promise left the
modal stuck. Production data corroborated — all 8 uploaded files were < 1 MB (largest
0.955 MB) against a 15 MB ceiling.

**Fix (D-057):** two-step signed-URL upload for BOTH `documents-library` and
`presentation-hub`. (1) an admin-gated action mints `createSignedUploadUrl` (no bytes
cross it); (2) the browser PUTs straight to Storage via `uploadToSignedUrl` (bypasses
the Next.js + Vercel body limits; the bucket `file_size_limit` 15/25 MB + MIME allowlist
still gate the PUT); (3) a second admin-gated `finalize…` action inserts the row, reads
the true size back via `.info()` (also confirms the object landed) and rolls the object
back on row failure. Both upload modals now wrap the flow in try/catch/finally so
"Uploading…" always clears and errors surface. Presentations keep tag-sync + the image
thumbnail (downloaded from Storage in finalize, since it no longer receives the File).
`replaceFile`/`replacePresentation` keep the old through-action path (same root cause,
out of scope here).

**Verify:** `pnpm typecheck` + `pnpm build` green; `pnpm lint` unchanged (no new findings
in the 4 changed files). A live >1 MB admin upload is to be verified on the PR preview
deploy — the sandbox lacks the Supabase publishable/secret keys for an E2E run.

---

## Dead-code cleanup + configurator page removal (2026-06-22)

**Status:** Pushed to `main` (`c397b29`), deploy READY. Decision **D-056**.

- **Dead-code cleanup (`c397b29`):** removed the legacy pre-File-System-v2
  document-library path (the `<DocumentLibrary>` component + `getDocumentLibrary`
  + its DTOs, superseded by D-053), the superseded
  `getBrandSections`/`BrandSection` (replaced by `getBrandSectionsAll`), the
  unused `ExternalIcon`, and four unused deps (`react-hook-form`,
  `@hookform/resolvers`, `class-variance-authority`, `tailwindcss-animate` — an
  abandoned form stack + shadcn scaffolding that was never wired up). `pnpm
  typecheck` + `build` green, deploy READY, page visually unchanged. ~474 LOC
  removed.
- **DB — `/internal-branding/configurator` removed:** its `component_key`
  `identity-configurator` had no backing component in `src/`, so the route only
  rendered the generic `HardcodedStub`. Judged not demo-relevant and removed.
  ⚠️ Done via `execute_sql` (a data change), **not yet a migration** — a fresh
  `db reset` would re-seed the page until the removal migration lands with the
  next `db push`. Deleted row saved in chat. See **D-056**.

## Flat design language — opaque surfaces, no orbs, no glass blur (2026-06-22)

Flattened the "iOS 18 Liquid Glass" look into "flat with subtle depth", almost
entirely via `theme.css` token values since the app is token-based:

- **Surfaces opaque** (light: `--surface`/`--surface-strong`/`--surface-flat`
  all `#FFFFFF`, `--bg #FAFAFA`, `--surface-muted #F4F4F5`; dark: `--surface`
  `#18181B`, `--bg #0E0E10`, `--surface-muted #232327`).
- **Shadows reduced** to a single soft layer (`--shadow-rest`/`--shadow-hover`).
- **Radii tightened**: `--radius-sm/md/lg/xl` → 6/8/10/12px;
  `--sidebar-panel-radius` 10px, `--sidebar-item-radius` 8px.
- **Glass blur removed** from all of `src/` except the APIX D-046 Webflow ports
  (`apix-*.css` keep their `backdrop-filter` verbatim).
- **Ambient orbs removed**: deleted `ambient.tsx`, the `.orb`/`.ambient`/orb
  keyframes in `shell.css`, `--orb-*` tokens (theme.css + the globals.css
  `@theme` bridge), the orbs menu item in `user-menu.tsx`, `OrbsIcon`,
  `data-orbs` on `<html>`, and the orbs branch of the pre-paint PREFS script.

**Known pre-existing issue (unrelated to this change):** `pnpm lint` reports 8
`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` errors from the merged intelligence layer —
identical on clean HEAD, in files this change does not touch. typecheck + build
are green. Locations:
`dashboard/hero/AIChatWindow.tsx:52`, `dashboard/hero/SearchAIBox.tsx:101` &
`:127`, `dashboard/hero/useTypewriterText.ts:23`,
`documents/move-targets.ts:36`, `presentations/move-targets.ts:30`,
`presentations/presentation-tags.ts:25`, `shell/user-settings-modal.tsx:24`.

## File System v2 — roles + folder Document Library (2026-06-20)

**Status:** Built + applied to prod (`zkydrymygjrscjbhusxp`) + pushed to `main`.
Decisions **D-047 … D-055**.

Replaced the flat `documents` library with a real folder file-manager gated by a
three-tier role model. Each migration was applied via the Supabase Management API
(MCP not connected this session) and verified; the two schema-bearing migrations
were run through an adversarial multi-lens review **before** touching prod.

- **Part A — roles (`0030`):** `profiles.role` → `super_admin|admin|user`;
  `is_admin()` kept (= admin OR super_admin) so all existing RLS still works;
  `is_super_admin()` added; `user_role_defaults` table + signup trigger
  (data-driven assignment); `admin/layout.tsx` allows both admin tiers.
- **Part B — library (`0031`):** `document_folders` (recursive tree,
  trigger-maintained `path`, slug CHECK) + `document_files` (one folder per file,
  `language` de/en/tr + anchorless `group_id` variant model), FORCE RLS keyed on
  per-folder `is_public`, a **private** `library` bucket, pg_trgm title index. No
  data migration — fresh uploads. Seeded starter folders (Business Development +
  Westhafen public; Finance + HR private).
- **Security fix (`0032`):** closed an admin self-promotion hole in the
  `profiles` UPDATE policy (role changes are super-admin-only).
- **App:** `lib/documents.ts` (RLS-scoped reads + role gates),
  `lib/documents-constants.ts`, gated signed-URL route `/api/library/file/[id]`,
  role-gated `documents-library/actions.ts`, the `[[...folder]]` route +
  `components/documents/*`, rewritten `document-library.css`, expandable sidebar
  node with real identity, and search/stats repointed to `document_files`
  (visibility-filtered). Verified live: anon sees only public folders; private
  folders + bogus file ids 404; search doesn't leak private titles.

---

## JetBrains Mono removed — Inter is the sole family (2026-06-18)

Removed JetBrains Mono (introduced in the previous run): dropped the
`next/font` import and `--font-jetbrains-mono` variable from `layout.tsx`, and
redefined `--font-mono` in `theme.css` to resolve to Inter (identical to
`--font`). The variable is kept so the existing `var(--font-mono)` usages
inherit Inter untouched — no monospace anywhere.

---

## Typography foundation — Inter + canonical type scale (2026-06-18)

Introduced Inter as the single sans family (self-hosted via `next/font`, with
JetBrains Mono for the mono token) and a canonical type scale as `:root` tokens
in `theme.css` (`--text-*`, `--leading-*`, `--weight-*`). Replaced every
hardcoded `font-size`/`line-height`/`font-weight` across `src/` with those
tokens. The four APIX Webflow ports (`apix-*.css`, `apix-network.tsx`) keep their
off-scale values verbatim per **D-046** (zero pixel drift) — exact-matching
values were tokenized, non-matching ones left as literals marked
`/* D-046 verbatim */`. Removed the dead `--font-geist-*` variables.

---

## Phase 3.5 — Design system + brand hierarchy (COMPLETE — 2026-06-15)

**Status:** All design decisions locked, DB restructured, docs consolidated.
**Tag:** `phase-3.5-design-consolidation`

### What was done

#### Design iteration (3 mockup rounds)

- **v1 (rejected):** Torch Red as UI accent — user feedback "too much red"
- **v2 (partly approved):** Switched to Quantum Blue, added collapsible sidebar
  with toggle, made orbs toggleable (on for landing, off for detail), softened
  card hover (no translate-Y bounce), tall color panels with hover-expand for
  brand color palettes
- **v3 (approved):** Final structure — Dashboard / Brands+Products (with IBE
  expandable) / Resources sections. Shadows +5%. Three document download styles
  side-by-side for review

Reference mockup committed to `spec/mockups/v3-01-dashboard.html`.

#### Webflow embed extraction (~224 KB)

Extracted custom HTML/CSS/JS from the original Webflow export for verbatim
preservation. Saved to `spec/embeds/`:

- `apix-page-embeds.html` (34 KB) — APIX Workflow + Global Network
- `apix-additional.css/.js` (88 KB) — APIX support code
- `ibe-tools-showcase.html` (15 KB) — full standalone IBE products showcase
- `jersey-customizer.html` + CSS/JS (17 KB) — Internal Branding tool
- `signature-generator.html` (0.6 KB) — email signature form
- `out-of-office-generator.html` (0.4 KB) — OOO message form
- `color-strip-pattern.html` (0.7 KB) — reference for color_palette block
- `service-page-support.css/.js` (66 KB) — shared support code

Maps to Phase 6 React components per `EMBEDS_INVENTORY.md`.

#### Database schema changes

Three new migrations applied via Supabase MCP:

- **0007_brand_hierarchy_and_sidebar.sql**
  - `brands.parent_id` (uuid, nullable, self-reference) — for IBE product hierarchy
  - `brands.is_product` (boolean) — distinguishes brand vs product-in-suite
  - `brands.sidebar_section` (text) — `brands` / `resources` / `hidden`
  - `pages.hidden_in_sidebar` (boolean) — for Playground, airLounge

- **0008_restructure_brands.sql**
  - Renamed `service-center` → `service-center-antalya` (brand + page slug + all sub-page paths)
  - Moved Presentation Hub to `sidebar_section = 'resources'`, made it `rendering_mode = 'hardcoded'` with `component_key = 'presentation-hub'`
  - Updated top-level brand `sort_order` to match final sidebar (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70)
  - Added 7 NEW IBE product sub-brands with `parent_id = (IBE Product Suite id)`: multicheck, cockpit, myTransfer, myBooking, rentalCar, myStats, airLounge
  - Re-linked existing IBE sub-pages to their new product brand_id
  - Marked airLounge sub-page `hidden_in_sidebar = true`
  - Marked Playground `hidden_in_sidebar = true`
  - Deleted 4 standalone pages (`/budget26`, `/ops`, `/image-grid`, `/focus-mgzn`)

- **0009_design_system_settings.sql**
  - Seeded `settings` table with design tokens, sidebar config, orb config,
    document download style preference, Presentation Hub section structure
  - Added `documents.download_style` column (per-document override)
  - Added `documents.presentation_section` column (for Presentation Hub categorization)

#### Final DB state after Phase 3.5

- Brands: **15** (8 original + 7 new IBE products)
- Pages: **52** (was 56, -4 standalone pages)
- Settings: 19 keys seeded

#### Spec consolidation

New files:
- `spec/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — full design language documentation
- `spec/EMBEDS_INVENTORY.md` — what we preserved from Webflow

Overwritten with new content:
- `spec/ARCHITECTURE.md` — reflects new 15-brand structure, 52 pages, design system
- `spec/DECISIONS.md` — added D-034 to D-046, marked D-010/D-011/D-023 superseded
- `spec/PHASE_PLAN.md` — Phase 4 onwards revised to new structure
- `spec/SOURCE_INVENTORY.md` — embeds inventory added, standalone pages removed
- `spec/BUILD_LOG.md` — this entry
- `README.md` — file list updated, structure note

Unchanged:
- `spec/CONTRIBUTING.md` — workflow rules still apply
- `spec/PRE_FLIGHT.md` — historical pre-Phase-1 doc

#### Locked design decisions

D-034 through D-046 added — see `DECISIONS.md`.

Key principles now enforced:
1. iOS 18 Liquid Glass design system with light + dark themes
2. Quantum Blue (`#0A82DF`) is the ONLY UI accent color
3. Torch Red, Orient Blue, etc., appear ONLY in brand identity content
4. Three document download styles available, default = preview cards
5. Brand hierarchy is two levels (parent → product)
6. Custom Webflow embeds preserved verbatim, ported 1:1 in Phase 6

### Next: Phase 4 — Public frontend (using new structure)

---

## Phase 3 — Next.js scaffold + auth shell (COMPLETE — 2026-06-15)

**Stack confirmed live:** Next.js 16.2.9 (Turbopack) + Tailwind 4.3.1 + Supabase SSR

### Scaffold
- `pnpm create next-app@latest` with TypeScript, Tailwind, App Router, src-dir
- Next.js bumped to 16.2.9 (was specced as "15" — see D-031)
- pnpm 11.7.0 + Node 24.16.0
- sharp not built locally (image optimization falls back, fine for now)
- Scaffold merged into `D:\terminal V2\` preserving spec/, supabase/, .git/
- Build green: `pnpm build` → "Compiled successfully"

### Auth dependencies
- @supabase/supabase-js 2.108.1, @supabase/ssr 0.12.0
- zod 4.4.3, react-hook-form 7.79.0, @hookform/resolvers 5.4.0
- clsx, tailwind-merge, class-variance-authority, lucide-react, tailwindcss-animate

### Files added
- `src/lib/utils.ts` — cn() helper
- `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` — browser client
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` — async server client (cookies() awaited)
- `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` — refreshSession() helper (cookie refresh only)
- `src/proxy.ts` — Next.js 16 proxy (replaces middleware.ts; see D-032)
- `src/app/login/page.tsx` — public login route
- `src/app/login/login-form.tsx` — Client Component with useTransition
- `src/app/login/actions.ts` — loginAction + logoutAction Server Actions
- `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` — auth gate via redirect() (see D-033)
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` — dashboard placeholder with live stats

### Verification
- Localhost: /admin → redirect /login → sign in dev@airtuerk.de → /admin OK
- Stats query returns Brands 8, Pages 56, Assets 759, Documents 47
  (Pre-Phase-3.5 numbers; Phase 3.5 changes brands to 15, pages to 52)
- Sign out → /login OK
- Production (terminalv2-dusky.vercel.app): identical behaviour verified

### Commits
- 317338e feat(auth): add login + admin shell with supabase auth

### Phase 3 follow-ups (deferred — addressed in Phase 4)
- Database types generation: add `db:types` script to package.json
- Fonts: upload Inter + GeneralSans to public/fonts/, configure next/font/local

---

## Phase 2 — Asset Upload (COMPLETE — 2026-06-15)

**Status:** All 759 files uploaded to Supabase Storage. Database tables populated.

### What was done

- Uploaded 708 images to images bucket (152 MB)
- Uploaded 47 documents to documents bucket (92 MB)
- Uploaded 4 videos to videos bucket (11 MB)
- 759 rows inserted into assets table
- 47 rows inserted into documents table with category, language, brand_id, version
- Documents auto-categorized into 12 categories
- 4 brands have linked documents: airtuerk-service (7), airtuerk-holidays (2), atbeds (1), airtuerk-apix (1)
- All public URLs verified working (HTTP 200, correct content-types)

### Deviations from spec

- 12 fonts not yet uploaded. Decision: defer to Phase 3 because Next.js scaffold uses next/font/local with files in /public/fonts/. The fonts bucket exists for future use but is empty for v1.
- Asset count is 759 not 708 — uploaded set slightly higher than original manifest. Dedup in Phase 5 admin tooling.

---

## Phase 1 — Infrastructure (COMPLETE — 2026-06-15)

**Status:** All infrastructure provisioned and verified.

### What was done

- Supabase project terminalv2 (ref: zkydrymygjrscjbhusxp)
- Region: eu-central-1 (Frankfurt), Pro tier, Postgres 17.6.1
- All 6 migrations applied via Supabase MCP
- 9 tables, RLS enabled on all
- 4 Storage buckets (images, documents, videos, fonts)
- 8 brands seeded, 56 pages seeded (later changed in Phase 3.5)
- Admin trigger active for dev@airtuerk.de
- First admin user created via Studio (role=admin via trigger)

- Vercel project terminalv2
- Team: airtuerk-service-gmbhs-projects
- Linked to GitHub airtuerkmarketing/terminalv2 (main branch)
- Env vars set, auto-deploy enabled
- Preview URL: terminalv2-dusky.vercel.app

- GitHub repo airtuerkmarketing/terminalv2 (private)

### Decision updates

- D-013: Pro tier active from start (org-level)
- D-027: Initial admin email hardcoded in handle_new_user() function due to Supabase Postgres permission model

---

## Phase 0 — Planning (COMPLETE)

Specification documents written and audited (2 review rounds).

---

## Phase 3+ roadmap (post Phase 3.5)

- **Phase 4 — Public frontend** (sidebar with new hierarchy, blocks, layouts, Liquid Glass theme)
- **Phase 5 — Admin CMS** (page editor, asset/doc/team managers, brand settings)
- **Phase 6 — Hardcoded interactives** (team, APIX workflow + global network, signature, OOO, identity configurator, IBE tools showcase, Presentation Hub sections)
- **Phase 7 — Polish + cutover** (full-text search, performance, a11y, SEO, DNS to Vercel)
- **Phase 8 — RAG search** (separate scope, later)

---

## Logging rules

- Entries terse: what changed, when, why if non-obvious
- Decisions go in DECISIONS.md, not here
- File forward only — never rewrite history
- Phase transitions get a header bump
